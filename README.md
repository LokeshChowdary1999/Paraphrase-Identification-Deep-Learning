# Paraphrase Identification Using Deep Learning

This project explores the task of paraphrase identification using deep learning techniques. Paraphrase identification involves determining whether two sentences convey the same meaning despite differences in wording. The project utilizes multiple neural architectures to evaluate their performance on the Quora Question Pairs dataset.

---

## Objective

The primary goal is to compare and analyze the effectiveness of different deep learning models for identifying semantic equivalence between sentence pairs.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Quora Question Pairs dataset**, which includes:
- **404,000 question pairs** labeled as either "Duplicate" or "Not Duplicate."
- An 80-20 split for training and testing.
